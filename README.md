**InvestProvider** is a contract that enables the creation and management of **Investment Pools (IDO Pools)**, allowing users to join pools by contributing funds (typically in stablecoins or other assets) in exchange for tokens issued by the **IDO project**. The contract handles pool creation, contributions, while ensuring compliance with investment limits and tracking remaining available tokens.

-   **Join Investment Pools:** Users can invest in the pools with specific amounts and terms.
-   **Integration with LockDealNFT:** Supports NFT tokenization of investments, leveraging LockDealNFT for minting and handling tokens.
-   **Security:** Implements access control and signature-based authorization for pool creation and investment

## Create IDO Pool

`createNewPool` function enables the creation of a new **IDO pool**, which is registered with the system. This function accepts a pool configuration, including the maximum investment amount, the provider managing the pool, and optionally cloning an existing pool's settings. This is ideal for creating **IDO pools** where the pool owner can manage the pool's parameters.

```solidity
    /**
    * @notice Creates a new IDO investment pool and registers it.
    * @param pool The pool configuration, including `maxAmount`, `whiteListId`, and `investedProvider`.
    * @param data Additional data for the pool creation.
    * @param sourcePoolId The ID of the source pool to clone settings from.
    * @return poolId The ID of the newly created pool.
    * @dev Emits the `NewPoolCreated` event upon successful creation.
    */
function createNewPool(
        Pool calldata pool,
        bytes calldata data,
        uint256 sourcePoolId
    )
```

```solidity
    struct Pool {
        uint256 maxAmount; // Maximum amount of tokens that can be invested in the pool
        uint256 poolId;    // Unique identifier for the pool
        IInvestedProvider investedProvider; // Provider that manages the invested funds
    }
```

This function allows you to set parameters like the maximum investment and the provider responsible for managing investments. It also supports cloning an existing pool's settings by referencing a `sourcePoolId`.

## Join Pool

`invest` function allows users to join an **IDO pool** by contributing a specified amount. It processes the user's contribution and updates the poolâ€™s data accordingly. This function requires the user to specify the pool ID, the amount to contribute, and additional data necessary for the transaction.

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice function allows users to invest in an IDO pool by specifying.
     * @param poolId The ID of the pool to invest in.
     * @param amount The amount to invest.
     * @param data Additional data for the investment.
     * @dev Emits the `Invested` event after a successful investment.
     */
function invest(
        uint256 poolId,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes calldata data
    )
```
